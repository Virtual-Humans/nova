# Virtual Humans Project

## Overview

The Sensitive Virtual Humans project aims to develop interactive virtual humans that combine realistic appearances with advanced AI capabilities, focusing on making human-AI interaction more natural and accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

## Project Status

- **Current Status**: In Development
- **Project Lead**: Mark de Graaf (m.degraaf@fontys.nl)
- **Started**: 2023
- **TRL Level**: 5 (Technology validated in relevant environment)
- **SRL Level**: 4 (Problem validated through pilot testing)

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create virtual humans that can integrate sensor data and LLMs for more natural interactions
- Incorporate non-verbal communication aspects into AI interactions
- Develop solutions that are inclusive and accessible to people with varying levels of digital literacy
- Bridge the gap between advanced AI technology and everyday users

## 🔑 Key Features

- Integration with various sensor data:
  - Face reading
  - Blood pressure monitoring
  - Skin resistance measurement
  - Voice analysis
- LLM integration for natural language processing
- Privacy-by-design approach
- Realistic virtual human representations using Metahuman technology

## 🛠️ Technical Infrastructure

- Built on shared architecture developed in collaboration with:
  - Cognitive Science and AI group (Tilburg University)
  - Virtual Humans group (Breda University of Applied Science)
- Integration with existing virtual human platforms
- Default hardware compatibility (webcams and microphones)

## 📈 Scalability Features

1. Universal design guidelines applicable across various use cases
2. Modular architecture allowing component upgrades (e.g., LLM replacement)
3. Diversified communication approaches for different user groups
4. Usage of commonly available technology
5. Cost-effective scaling capabilities for mass deployment

## 🤝 Partnerships
